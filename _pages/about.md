## 💡 What I Do

I love building things that work reliably, scale gracefully, and occasionally surprise me with a `200 OK`.

- 🧱 **Backend Engineering** — NodeJS, NestJS, Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery... basically my playground  
- 🌐 **Frontend (when absolutely necessary)** — ReactJS, Redux, and HTML/CSS magic  
- ⚙️ **DevOps & Infra** — Docker, Kubernetes, GCP, AWS, Terraform, Git (with as few `--force` pushes as possible)  
- 📊 **Data Pipelines** — Airbyte, DBT, custom ETL flows, and SQL queries that don't need `EXPLAIN`... usually  
- 🧪 **Testing** — Pytest, Unittest, Swagger docs, and tests that actually run on CI

## 🏆 Nerd Stats

- CodeChef 4★ (1930) · Codeforces Specialist (1422)  
- Solved 1200+ problems across LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef  
- Authored 35+ problems on HackerEarth that stumped more people than I expected  
- Co-organized a Codeforces-rated contest at LNMIIT

## 🚀 Outside Work

When I'm not shipping code or debugging my own brain:
- I'm usually designing side projects or playing with system design puzzles  
- Writing articles, creating tools, or helping juniors prep for tech roles  
- Secretly refreshing [AWS status page](https://status.aws.amazon.com/) during outages just for fun
